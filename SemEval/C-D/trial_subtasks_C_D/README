There are ten topics and about 20 tweets per topic. The topic is encoded in the file name.

For subtask C, the data is split into separate files, where the file name encodes the topic.

For subtask D, the data is split into strongly/weakly positive, strogly/weakly negative, and neutral trends in the respective folders and subfolders (not that we lack examples in two of these categories).
